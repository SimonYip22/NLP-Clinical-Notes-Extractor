# NLP-Based ICU Clinical Notes Extractor

***Structured Extraction and Interoperability from ICU Notes Using ClinicalBERT & Rule-Based NLP**

---

## Project Focus

This project extracts clinically relevant, structured information from ICU patient notes to generate actionable outputs in FHIR-compatible format. It demonstrates advanced NLP skills, clinical knowledge integration, and practical deployment, complementing your previous ICU Time-Series Predictor.

**Key focus areas:**
- Extract structured entities (e.g., symptoms, interventions, complications) from unstructured ICU notes
- Map entities to **SNOMED** terms for interoperability
- Output structured data in **FHIR JSON**
- Build a clinician-friendly **Streamlit demo**
- Optional: augment ICU Predictor features with extracted insights (multi-modal integration)

## 1. Scope & Deliverables

### 1.1 Standard Components (6–8 weeks)
- **Rule-based + scispaCy** NLP pipeline for entity extraction
- **ClinicalBERT classifier** for classifying extracted entities
- **SNOMED mapping** of entities for interoperability
- **FHIR JSON output** to standardize extracted data
- **Streamlit demo** for per-note structured output

### 1.2 High-Impact Advanced Component (Optional)
- **ICU Predictor Integration**  
  - Select 5–10 clinically meaningful features extracted from notes
  - Feed them as optional inputs into the existing ICU predictor
  - Show delta in key metrics and case-level examples
  - Adds strong multi-modal demonstration value without full retraining
