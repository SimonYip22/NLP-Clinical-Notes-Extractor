# Hybrid Clinical Information Extraction Pipeline

***Hybrid Natural Language Processing Architecture Using ClinicalBERT Classifier & Rule-Based Entity Extraction for Structured Clinical Data***

---

## Executive Summary

**Tech stack:** ***Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, scikit-learn***

This project implements a precision-first clinical natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for extracting structured information from unstructured ICU clinical notes. The system combines deterministic rule-based entity extraction with context-aware transformer classification (ClinicalBERT) to produce clean, auditable, machine-readable outputs suitable for downstream machine learning applications.

The dual-architecture pipeline converts ICU progress notes into structured clinical entities, with outputs following a standardised JSON schema. Rule-based extraction ensures high-precision identification of clinically relevant patterns, while the ClinicalBERT classifier provides contextual disambiguation and validation of ambiguous spans.

The project focuses on classical clinical NLP pipeline development rather than ontology mapping, interoperability standards, or production deployment. Model training was performed using credentialed access to the MIMIC-IV dataset via PhysioNet, ensuring realistic clinical data handling and scenario simulation.
