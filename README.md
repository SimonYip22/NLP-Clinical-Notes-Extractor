# Hybrid Clinical Notes Extraction Pipeline

***Precision-First Natural Language Processing Architecture Using ClinicalBERT Classifier & Rule-Based Entity Extraction for Structuring Clinical Notes***

---

## Executive Summary

**Tech stack:** ***Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, scikit-learn***

This repository presents a dual-architecture natural language processing (NLP) pipeline combining deterministic rule-based entity extraction with context-aware transformer (ClinicalBERT) validation to produce structured, schema-aligned JSON outputs from unstructured ICU progress notes suitable for downstream machine learning applications.

Rule-based extraction ensures high-precision identification of clinically relevant patterns, while the fine-tuned ClinicalBERT classifier provides negation handling, entity validation, and contextual disambiguation.

This focused on classical clinical NLP pipeline development rather than ontology mapping, interoperability standards, or production deployment. Model training was performed using credentialed access to the MIMIC-IV dataset via PhysioNet, ensuring realistic clinical data handling.
