# Phase 1 — Corpus Profiling Summary

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document synthesises the structural findings from Phase 1 and distils them into system-level constraints.

Phase 1 examined the working ICU progress note corpus (n ≈ 200) to determine:

- Overall structural composition
- Degree of formatting and lexical variability
- Stability of section semantics
- Surface-level regularities relevant to deterministic extraction

This summary does not reproduce statistics or code outputs.  
Instead, it identifies dominant trends, variability boundaries, and structural risks observed during profiling.

It clarifies:

- What patterns are stable and exploitable
- Where variability introduces extraction risk
- What constraints the corpus imposes on rule design
- What assumptions are now fixed
- What Phase 2 must explicitly account for

The goal of this document is to convert empirical observation into architectural direction.
